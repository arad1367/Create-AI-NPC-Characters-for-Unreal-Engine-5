## 🎮 AI and NPCs Characters – Game Development Series

This repository is part of my **YouTube series: _“AI and NPCs Characters”_**, where I explore how **Artificial Intelligence can accelerate NPC creation** for modern game development using **Unreal Engine 5**.

In this project, I demonstrate **multiple AI-powered workflows** to create a **fully functional NPC**:
- From **Text-to-3D** and **Image-to-3D**
- To **texturing**, **rigging**, **animation**
- And finally importing the character into **Unreal Engine 5**

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ AI-powered **Text-to-3D** character generation  
- ✅ **Image-to-3D** NPC creation  
- ✅ Automatic **AI texturing**
- ✅ **Auto-rigging & animation** using Mixamo  
- ✅ Full **NPC integration in Unreal Engine 5**
- ✅ Multiple workflows for flexibility and experimentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

### 🔹 Meshy.ai – AI 3D Character Generation
Used to generate 3D models via **text prompts** and **images**, enabling rapid prototyping of NPC characters.
